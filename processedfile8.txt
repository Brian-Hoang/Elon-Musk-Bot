SpaceX, meanwhile, was testing its Dragon spacecraft for a docking with the International Space Station—Musk clearly relished the distraction, carving out still more time for a tour of the house.', 'Situated atop a hidden hill that overlooks the Pacific Ocean, the 1.6-acre grounds boast a tennis court (Musk’s brother, Kimbal, jokes that their infrequent matches get so competitive that he needs to run away after making a winning shot), an outdoor pool, and a footpath leading to a giant tree upon which Musk, the father of 7-year-old twins and 5-year-old triplets, all boys, plans to build a tree fort.', 'The inside is just as grand, with all the expected billionaire trappings, down to the cavernous wine cellar and the master bathroom so big Musk put a treadmill in it.', 'What was missing from all of this, though, was any sign of actual people.', 'The white shelves in a towering library stand embarrassingly bare.', '(Musk devours books exclusively on his iPhone, most recently  The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin  and Walter Isaacson’s  Steve Jobs .)', 'The pool is covered, the manicured backyard devoid of toys, lawn chairs, or a grill.', 'The boys are at school—Musk, having been through a much-publicized divorce, shares custody of his sons with his college sweetheart,  Justine .', 'His second wife, Talulah Riley, a 26-year-old British actress, is, I’m told, back in her home country filming a movie.', 'There is no evidence—clothes, shoes, makeup—of a female inhabitant.', 'There aren’t even any personal photographs to speak of, save a 3-foot panoramic shot of Musk and Riley watching an eclipse in front of a private yacht on some remote tropical beach, his arms wrapped around her as they both gaze skyward, laughing.', 'On another wall, a photo of a chair seems to be the placeholder that came with the frame.', 'I ask Musk if he has a dog.', 'Yes, he says, two.', 'But no dish, leashes, or chew toys are in sight.', 'The house, he tells me, is leased.', 'So is the furniture.', 'Although Musk lives here, in other words, it would be an exaggeration to call this his home.', 'For now, it’s a way station, the perfect place to play dystopian video games.', 'At 6-foot-1, with broad shoulders and legs that match his first name (Elon is Hebrew for “oak tree,” although Musk’s family comes from Pennsylvania Dutch stock, not Jewish), he fills out the burgundy Tesla Roadster—which he chose over his Audi Q7 and Porsche 911—for the 20-mile drive to the Hawthorne-based headquarters of SpaceX.', 'Pulling onto the 405, he attentively configures the optimum temperature and wind levels for the convertible; programs a mix of Robbie Williams, Adele, and Beethoven’s Fifth; and drives fast and clinically.', 'It’s all done in a manner that reflects his public perception as a robotic genius—the real-life inspiration for the Tony Stark character in Jon Favreau’s  Iron Man .', '24 Comment on this story      Page  1 / 5    Continue                                             Print    Website Feedback    News Tip    Report Corrections    Reprints & Permissions']
