 Elon Musk and wife Talulah Riley are giving the marriage a second shot - for the second time. The South African-born tech billionaire and the English actress - who were married in 2010, divorced in 2012 and then remarried in 2013 - are back together after Musk reportedly withdrew divorce papers he filed in January. News of their reconciliation was first reported in May by  The Mail on Sunday . Scroll own for video      
 
 
 
 
 
   Back on: Elon Musk has reportedly withdrawn divorce papers against his wife Talulah Riley (pair above in July)     
 
 
 
 
 
   Happy day: The tech billionaire and the English actress - who were married in 2010, divorced in 2012 and then remarried in 2013 - are now back together (above in 2009) TMZ  reports that Musk has filed a request to dismiss the divorce, and that Riley is on board with the decision. This comes less than a month after the two were spotted holding hands at the annual Allen & Company conference in Sun Valley, Idaho.  The couple also seemed close this past May while in Cannes.

 It was there that a source told Mail on Sunday; ‘Her friends think they will now have some kind of commitment ceremony. It’s funny – every time they get back together the celebrations become smaller. ‘I suppose it’s sort of embarrassing in a way, but at the same time really lovely that they just can’t keep away from each other.’ Musk, 44, and Riley, 29, first wed in 2010, at a ceremony held in Scotland, but divorced shortly after in 2012. He announced on Twitter that it had been an ‘amazing’ few years and that he would always love her, paying out $4.2million in a settlement. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 On and off: The pair have been divorced once, and remarried soon after (left in 2013, right in May) Months after the first divorce, they were back together – and remarried in July 2013. But the couple lived apart for much of last year while Talulah wrote and directed her first feature film, Scottish Mussel. Divorce papers were again filed on new Year's Day with the couple insisting that the split was amicable and Musk agreeing to pay $16million in a settlment. It is uncertain if Riley will still see that money, though with an estimated worth of $14billion Musk likely would not miss the money that much.   Prior to his relationship with Riley, Musk was married to Canadian author Justine Wilson. The pair  wed in 2000 and then divorced in 2008. They had five children together - twins Griffin and Xavier, and triplets Damian, Saxon, and Kai.
