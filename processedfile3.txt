Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla's Elon Musk are investing  $40 million into an artificial intelligence company called  Vicarious alongside actor and tech investor Ashton Kutcher,     reports the Wall Street Journal .", 'Vicarious is a company aiming to replicate the human neocortex as  computer code.', 'The neocortex is the rather important part of your  brain that "sees, controls the body, understands language, and  does math."', 'Company founder Scott Phoenix told the WSJ that once  they successfully accomplish this task, "you have a computer that  thinks like a person except it doesn\'t need to eat or sleep."', 'After that, Phoenix said, the next task is to create  " a computer that can understand  not just shapes and objects, but the textures associated with  them.', "For example, a computer might understand 'chair.'", "It might  also comprehend 'ice.'", 'Vicarious wants to create a computer that  will understand a request like \'show me a chair made of  ice.\'"', "If this sounds like a tall  order, it's only because it is.", 'The applications described above  may still be decades out from happening, but there are more  immediately useful ways of using this technology:   Facebook, for instance, wants  to turn the massive amounts of information shared by its users  into a database of wisdom.', 'Ask Facebook a question, and, if all  goes to plan, it will spit out an answer based on facts users  have shared.', 'Facebook is also using artificial intelligence for  facial recognition to identify users in photos.', 'Facebook recently  hired a leader in artificial intelligence, Yann LeCun, to run a  new lab.', 'Phoenix acknowledges that Vicarious has an uphill battle ahead.', 'He told WSJ that it "won\'t make a profit anytime soon" and hasn\'t  disclosed many details about\xa0 how  this technology  will work.', "As for where the company's located, they won't even  reveal a complete address in case someone should try to hack  them.", "This is not the company's first major injection of capital.", 'In  2010, Peter Thiel invested $1.2 million, and a second group of  investors (including Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz) gave  the company $15 million in 2012.', 'Get more information on WSJ >>   Get the latest Tesla stock price   here.', 'Post category tags                More:
