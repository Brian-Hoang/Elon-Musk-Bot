 Billionaire  Elon Musk  and actor Talulah Riley are making another attempt to end their second marriage. 
 Riley filed to divorce Musk on Monday in Los Angeles superior court. Musk filed for divorce on New Year’s Eve in 2014 but withdrew the petition seven months later. 
 The divorce is amicable and the pair agreed Riley would file the petition to end their latest marriage after roughly two years. According to the statement, Musk and Riley have been living separately for the past six months and plan to remain friends. 
 Musk co-founded Paypal and has gone on to help start the electric car company Tesla Motors and the private space firm SpaceX. He is also a champion of building a hyperloop that would transport people and cargo at the speed of sound. Riley appeared in Pride & Prejudice and Inception and wrote and directed her first feature film, Scottish Mussel, in 2014. 
 The pair first married in 2010 and divorced in 2012. They remarried 18 months later.  
 Riley sat in the front row at September’s unveiling of Tesla’s Model X sport utility vehicle. Musk is scheduled to unveil the newest version of Tesla’s electric car, the lower-cost Model 3, at an event later this month. 
 Musk and Riley do not have any children together, although he has five sons from a previous marriage.
